    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Synopsis\n",
    "\n",
    "During the summer of 2022, Google engaged **SLNT MISSION** to conduct a security assessment of VPN by Google One. VPN by Google One is a service that increases connection security and privacy to end users. Google provides several clients covering the most widely used operating systems; these VPN clients provide both encrypted transit and IP address dissociation for packets between user’s devices and the VPN servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The product’s security and privacy goals, as stated in the product’s whitepaper, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ “We focus on three core principles: keeping our users’ information secure, treating it responsibly, and putting our users in control.”\n",
    "+ “With VPN by Google One, we will never use the VPN connection to track, log, or sell your online activity.”\n",
    "+ “A Google-grade VPN that provides additional security and privacy to online connectivity without undue performance sacrifices.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "**SLNT MISSION's** evaluation included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Security Design and Architecture Review\n",
    "- VPN Library Code Review\n",
    "- Windows Application Security Assessment \n",
    "- MacOS Application Security Assessment\n",
    "- Android Application Security Assessment\n",
    "- iOS Application Security Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing was performed in the production environment, having access to the relevant source code for the tested platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical component analysis and source code review uncovered twenty-four initial findings in total, comprising:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>Three findings rated medium-severity.</mark>\n",
    "- <mark>Nine findings rated as informational observations.</mark>\n",
    "- <mark>Ten findings rated low-severity.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most notable finding was related to the requirement of the Windows application to be executed with administrator privileges. While **SLNT MISSION** did not find any software vulnerabilities in this application, potential insecure coding practices could result in a privilege escalation attack. This issue was correctly addressed by Google during the retest, and now the application is executed with user privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two medium risk findings found were in the login process of both Windows and MacOS applications, which would allow local malicious applications to deny the availability of the service, or obtain the OAuth token sent after a successful login, by manipulating local ports temporarily opened by the applications during the login process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Although no significant risks were identified in this assessment, it is recommended that the issues outlined in this report are reviewed in line with a suitably robust defense in depth approach which continuously monitors the organization’s security posture.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Threat Model\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first two weeks of the engagement, **SLNT MISSION** performed an assessment of the Google PPN VPN service to ensure its design would be able to facilitate the product’s security and privacy goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The VPN by Google One is a product that endeavors to protect users in a way that reduces opportunities for manipulation, interception or analysis of network traffic by third parties in privileged positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![threat model](./threat-model.png \"Threat Model of VPN by Google One\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "**SLNT MISSION** performed an architecture assessment of both the current PPN environment as well as a future architecture that Google is expecting to begin to deploy in Q3 of 2022. During this assessment, **SLNT MISSION** created three architecture diagrams. The first two diagrams document the current environment, with the first including the client portions and the second focused on the server-side architecture. The third diagram documents the future release.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- G1 APP: The application responsible for hosting the VPN service and initializing the PPN library. It also provides notifications and account management.\n",
    "- PPN Service: Java subclass of Android VPN service that runs in the same memory space as the host app. Responsible for the actual implementation of the Android VPN APIs.\n",
    "- Xenon: The PPN network-switching layer. This library talks directly to Android and is responsible for switching Krypton’s data plane between Wi-Fi and cell networks.\n",
    "- Krypton Service and library: PPN C++ library that implements data plane of the VPN, talking directly to Datapath session manager Copper.\n",
    "- Datapath Client: Open-Source software application and communication protocol that implements VPN techniques to create secure point-to-point connections in routed or bridged configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brass Backend: Dataplane manager and key management service. It provides the public key of the data node. According to the request made from client device, it determines the specific dataplane node to use, programs the node with the client device’s public key and receives a new public key the dataplane generates for return to the client device.\n",
    "- Copper(Session Manager): The exit node responsible for sending and receiving the packets from the device and the internet.\n",
    "- Zinc Backend: The current authentication server that is responsible for authentication and authorization of the PPN service where it proxies GAIA authentications to Bronze.\n",
    "- Keyring Bucket: Responsible for serving the public key, signing and verification requests.\n",
    "- Bridge-Proxy Backend: talks to Bridge server to get valid Bridge token and sends to the bridge controller.\n",
    "- Bridge-Server: Provides a valid token to the bridge-proxy.\n",
    "- Bridge Controller: Handles requests to program the packet Processor.\n",
    "- Phosphor: New closed source authentication server that will replace Zinc and Bronze in\n",
    "a future release. It provides access to the public key, authentication, signing and\n",
    "eligibility remote procedure calls (RPCs).\n",
    "- Bronze: Closed source authentication server that is responsible for GAIA and G1 service\n",
    "authorizations which Zinc talks to and validates from.\n",
    "- Attestation Service: A service running within the Phosphor instance that handles device\n",
    "attestation from Android and iOS devices.\n",
    "- DB Spanner: Used to store the nonces that will be signed by the Attestation Service.\n",
    "- G1 Benefits: Tells if the user has a PPN subscription.\n",
    "- Play: Responsible for device attestation (Android).\n",
    "- GAIA: Responsible for service authorization.\n",
    "- Packet Processor: Provides a platform for low-level network packet processing\n",
    "applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Conclusions\n",
    "At the end of the review, **SLNT MISSION** concluded that the PPN design allows Google to implement user authentication and authorization for the service in a way that isolates the user’s Google identity (referred to internally as Gaia ID) from the VPN session network flows. The use of cryptographic blind signing during authorization is the traffic anonymization strategy, protecting user’s identity from direct association with the VPN session token. However, as the privacy threat model considers Google itself as an adversary in a privileged position, this review also identified several techniques that could be employed to compromise user anonymity should Google choose or be compelled to actively violate its privacy claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that none of these techniques were observed to be part of the product’s strategy or implementation. Furthermore, the migration planned with the induction of Phosphor server include a specific component known as Attestation Service with the specific purpose of refusing authentication if the client application has been manipulated\n",

    "### Impact\n",
    "TLS traffic between the application and the server can be intercepted if a trusted certificate authority is compromised; or if an attacker is able to install a malicious certificate on the user’s device and has a privileged network position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The authentication communications with the PPN service did not implement certificate pinning. This is a security feature which involves hard-coding the expected TLS certificate of the server (or a particular certificate authority) into the application, rather than relying on the certificate chain validation function offered by the underlying platform and the PKI infrastructure. This mitigates the risk from various active attacks which could be performed against the application’s TLS connection, and lead to attackers being able to intercept the application’s communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the use of certificate pinning mitigates the risk associated with one of the device’s trusted certificate authorities becoming compromised. Although this has happened on several occasions in recent years2,3 , certification authorities are required to follow strict security standards, so these kind of attacks are usually performed by state sponsored or highly profile threat actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "In order to further secure communications and information handled by the application, it is recommended to implement certificate pinning to mitigate the risk of interception when a certification authority is compromised.\n",
    "Since Android 7.0 (SDK 24), applications can use the Network Security Config4 to define a list of trusted certificate hashes without manual checking being necessary. Information about this mechanism is available on Android’s developer documentation5.\n",
    "\n",
    "For applications which need to support older devices, consider using a library with built-in support for pinning. For example, Square’s OkHttp library enables pinning with a few lines of code6.\n",
    "Consider also pinning intermediate or root certification authorities instead of individual host certificates, since it reduces the risk associated with certificate handling but still provides\n",
    "a strong protection, as the attack surface is reduced to the specific CA pinned, and not the whole PKI infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reproduce\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install a custom system CA in the mobile device (for devices with SDK >= 24), or user CA (for devices with SDK < 24)\n",
    "2. Intercept the application’s SSL traffic to pass through an interception proxy \n",
    "3. Verify that TLS traffic can be decrypted\n",

    "### Impact\n",
    "Other android applications installed on the device can interact with the exported services. However, it is not exploitable due to checks inherited from the tiktok libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The PPN package of the G1 Android Application exported two broadcast receivers that were not protected by Android permissions. In normal conditions, this would allow other applications installed on the Android device to interact with these receivers, causing unwanted behavior. However, the receivers expected protected intents that can only be sent by system services, and inherited methods from the tiktok libraries that ensured that the action of the intent matched the ones in the filter, avoiding the exploitation of this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two (2) broadcast receivers were exported in the Android manifest file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<receiver\n",
    "    android:exported=\"true\"\n",
    "    android:name=\".PackageReplacedPpnStateCheckReceiver_Receiver\">\n",
    "    <intent-filter>\n",
    "        <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED\"/>\n",
    "    </intent-filter>\n",
    "    </receiver>\n",
    "    <receiver\n",
    "        android:exported=\"true\"\n",
    "        android:name=\".BootCompletedPpnStateCheckReceiver_Receiver\">\n",
    "    <intent-filter>\n",
    "        <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\"/>\n",
    "    </intent-filter>\n",
    "</receiver>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The intent filters declared define that the expected actions are `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` or `BOOT_COMPLETED`. Both intents are protected and can only be broadcasted by Android system components, and therefore other applications can’t send these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code of the components called startPpnIfUserEnabled , which received the action sent as an argument. However, this function only checked that the action was one of the expected ones to log an event and would continue the execution even with other actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (!Strings.isNullOrEmpty(intentAction)) {\n",
    "    switch (intentAction) {\n",
    "        case \"android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED\":\n",
    "            clearcutLogger.logEvent(GoogleOneClientEventType.PPN_START_ON_PACKAGE_REPLACED);\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "        case \"android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\":\n",
    "            clearcutLogger.logEvent(GoogleOneClientEventType.PPN_START_ON_BOOT_COMPLETED);\n",
    "        break;\n",

    "\n",
    "return PropagatedFutures.transformAsync(ppnStateController.getEligiblePpnAccountId(), this::startPpn, directExecutor());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code would have allowed other applications installed in the device to directly interact with these receivers by sending explicit intents and other arbitrary actions. However, it was found that the receivers used the `IntentFilterAcledReceiver` class of the tiktok library, that checked if the intent action was expected by the intent filters, raising an exception when the action did not match with the intent filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "As the tiktok IntentFilterAcledReceiver class is protecting the receivers from receiving unwanted intent actions, no action is needed. However, consideration should be given to implement android permissions for these components.\n",
